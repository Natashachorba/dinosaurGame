# dinosaurGame
A 3D game in unreal that has something to do with dinosaurs

The plan was that there would be different combinations of materials that would
create items, which were an axe, a flamethrower, a laser,and finally a jet pack.
Each of these would be created once the sufficient items were collected. They 
would be used to get through to new areas to collect new pieces. In addition,
each area would have a new piece of the Time Machine.
All assets were built and most were even imported into Unreal, but simply not
added to the scene due to github issues with merge conflicts and unreal being
generally unhappy with git.
area 1 would have trees blocking the passageway which would require an axe to
get past. Within area 1 would be the materials for a flamethrower and the first
piece of the time machine. The flamethrower was going to be a breath attack
Area 2 would have a giant metal sheet blocking the path that would require the
flamethrower to melt to get through. In this area would be found the materials
for creating a laser and the 2nd part of the time machine. The laser would be in
the form of laser eyes. (Without the stretch goals, instead this area would give
materials for the jetpack)
(This area was a stretch goal as laser was similar to flamethrower)Area 3
would require the laser to hit a targetto get into the area. The area would have
materials for building a jetpack. The jetpack went on your back.
The final area was up a steep hill that required the jetpack to reach the top
of. The area had the last piece of the time machine.
Through getting these items the image of the time machine would be incremented
until it was full at which point interacting it would trigger the end cutscene.
